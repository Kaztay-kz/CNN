Classifing small images cifar10 dataset with 10 classes
Using Convolutional neural network(CNN) classify small images of some dataset
cifar10 dataset used for this project (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
A CNN's architecture is analogous to the connectivity pattern of the human brain. Just like the brain consists of billions of neurons, CNNs also have neurons arranged in a specific way. CNN's are best for image classification and gives superb accuracy. Also computation is much less compared to simple ANN as maxpooling reduces the image dimensions while still preserving the features
